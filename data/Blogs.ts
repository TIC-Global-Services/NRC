Every quarter brings a new narrative — but those who look beyond the noise often find extraordinary value in one overlooked space: small-cap equities. At Nine Rivers Capital, we believe that long-term investing in quality small caps is one of the most powerful and consistent paths to wealth creation. Not because it's easy — but because it allows disciplined investors to participate in the entire journey of business compounding."

These companies are typically early in their lifecycle, often founder-led, and positioned in expanding markets. Because they operate below the radar of most analysts, small caps experience higher inefficiency and volatility — but that's precisely where time becomes an ally. In small caps, inefficiency isn't a drawback — it's the opportunity patient investors capitalize on. For investors who think in decades, not quarters, this inefficiency provides fertile ground for superior compounding."

A large-cap business compounding at 10–12% annually may preserve wealth, but a well-managed small cap compounding earnings at 20–25% for a decade can multiply value nearly tenfold. However, such growth rarely happens in straight lines. It unfolds over years of execution, innovation, and balance sheet strengthening — a journey that demands investor patience. This time arbitrage — the willingness to stay invested through fluctuations — becomes a structural advantage that short-term capital cannot replicate."

Impatience with Volatility: Small caps can correct sharply — 30–40% moves are normal within long-term uptrends. Many investors exit precisely when value emerges. B. Short-Term Anchoring: Investors often anchor to recent prices rather than intrinsic value or long-term earnings power. C. Narrative Fatigue: Stories that take years to play out test conviction. Most exit before the business inflection point arrives. Volatility is the test. Patience is the reward. At Nine Rivers Capital, we interpret drawdowns not as danger signals, but as the toll gates of compounding — the price of long-term returns."

India's market history is filled with examples: Industrial niche players that became category leaders. Regional brands that scaled nationally. IT enablers that transformed into global platforms. Each story followed the same arc — volatility early, visibility later, value eventually. The difference between good outcomes and great ones is often just how long the investor stayed invested."

Patience as Alpha: We align our holding periods with business cycles, not market sentiment. This helps us capture the compounding of earnings, not just temporary valuation reratings. 3. Constructive Concentration: Rather than over-diversification, we prefer conviction — a focused portfolio of high-quality small and mid-sized businesses positioned for sustainable growth. Our conviction comes from data, not hope — and our patience comes from process, not emotion."

The essence of small-cap investing is simple: time turns volatility into opportunity, and opportunity into wealth. The Nine Rivers View: Endurance is the real alpha. In small caps, value doesn't appear overnight — it unfolds over years. The investor's edge isn't in speed, but in steadfastness."

What changes now is scale, policy support and the convergence of global supply-chain reconfiguration with domestic structural reforms. Over the next decade (2025–2035), the most durable value creation is likely to come not from headline giants but from the thousands of SMEs and small-cap listed companies that sit inside regional value chains and are rapidly digitizing, formalizing and exporting. At Nine Rivers Capital we view this as a multi-year structural opportunity: policy incentives and private investment are building capacity and demand-side change is creating markets — a fertile set-up for small caps and SMEs to compound. Below we map the forces at play, quantify the momentum today, and show why patient, research-driven investors should pay attention."

                content: "Two policy and capital facts define the near-term landscape. First, India's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) programme — expanded since 2020 — is now a centerpiece of manufacturing policy. The government's consolidated PLI outlay and approvals span 14 sectors and have attracted large committed investments; by mid-2025 PLI-linked commitments and approvals had reached tens of thousands of crores, with reports indicating invested/committed sums in the range of ₹1.6–1.9 lakh crore across multiple tranches and sectors. This is not one sector's push — it's a multi-sector industrial accelerator. Second, manufacturing activity and GVA have shown renewed traction: official and press trackers reported manufacturing GVA growth and rising output in FY24–FY25, with manufacturing output growth materially improving year-on-year and manufacturing GVA rising strongly (reports noted an ~12% rise in manufacturing GVA in FY24). These numbers reflect real activity — capex, order books and hiring — not just headline aspirations. Implication: PLI capital + rising GVA create capacity and demand for domestic suppliers — the SMEs and small caps that sit in the supply chain benefit first and most."

Official data shows MSME-related products comprise roughly 45% of India's exports in recent years — a striking number that highlights MSMEs' centrality in trade and manufacturing ecosystems. The same data also points to rapid formalization and credit flow improvements into the sector. Implication: When export demand or import-substitution gains momentum, MSMEs are immediate beneficiaries — and for listed small caps with SME linkages, this converts into revenue and margin expansion."

That creates opportunities for India's specialized SMEs to win components and sub-assembly work. Domestic policy levers (PLI, PLI-adjacent schemes) — these lower the effective cost of scale and provide a multi-year revenue visibility for the ecosystem. Digital & automation adoption — affordable automation and SaaS enable operational scaling, improving unit economics for smaller plants. Rising local demand — formalization and urbanization increase demand for quality, branded, and compliant manufacturing — an area where nimble regional firms can expand quickly. Together, these forces mean that small companies can capture outsized revenue growth vs. the broader market in a multi-year window."

PLI scale: With committed/approved PLI investments already reported in the hundreds of thousands of crores (₹1.2–1.9 lakh crore band by different updates), the capex pipeline is sizable and multi-sectoral, implying multi-year supply-chain demand for ancillary units and component manufacturers. Manufacturing GVA: Recent reporting showed manufacturing GVA growth of ~12% in FY24 (y/y) and renewed output growth in FY25 — a sign of improving activity and demand. SME export share: MSME product share in exports hovers around ~45%, meaning export growth lifts a broad base of smaller suppliers, not only a handful of large firms. Market signal: India's small-cap indices have been the traditional home for higher beta / higher-growth names; when manufacturing activity converts into earnings, the small-cap universe historically re-rates more sharply than large caps — offering compounding upside for early, patient investors. Implication: These are not isolated datapoints. When PLI converts to factories, factories purchase from SMEs; SMEs grow revenues and export; listed small caps with the right positioning can convert that into outsized earnings growth."

We highlight three reasons why active, concentrated exposure (not passive or indiscriminate small-cap ownership) makes sense: Quality variance is large. Governance, capital allocation and promoter capability separate winners from losers. Operational execution matters. Companies that can scale quality, meet compliance and service global buyers will win market share. Valuations are uneven. Mispricings are frequent — disciplined research and concentration can capture the full compounding arc. At Nine Rivers Capital, the winning play is quality + patience + selective concentration — backing firms that have the right market, management, and capital discipline to scale over 3–7 years."

Conviction with Control: Around 20 high-conviction holdings — enough focus for alpha, enough spread for stability. Dynamic Balance: Allocation across large, mid, and small caps evolves with opportunity, not emotion. Favourable Risk-Reward: Preference for mispriced, under-owned companies where downside is limited but upside significant. Flexibility guided by research creates resilience; freedom without process creates noise."

Each strategy serves a different purpose, yet both draw from the same investment DNA — deep research, valuation discipline, and a long-term horizon. They are distinct strategies for distinct investors, unified by one principle: creating enduring wealth through disciplined investing."

Flexi Cap portfolios represent that philosophy — they allow participation in India's evolving market while preserving the discipline of long-term investing. At Nine Rivers Capital, the Aurum Multiplier Portfolio is our expression of that balance — a research-driven, valuation-anchored, dynamically managed strategy for investors who seek growth without losing sight of governance and risk. For those who seek a more concentrated pursuit of alpha, our Small Cap Strategy remains a distinct path within the same philosophy — built on the same foundations of research, discipline, and patience. Flexibility gets you through cycles. Discipline carries you beyond them. The Nine Rivers View: Investing is not about choosing between growth and safety — it's about calibrating both."
